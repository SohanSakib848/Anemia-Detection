# Anemia Detection using CatBoost

This app uses a trained **CatBoost** model to predict anemia based on various blood test parameters. Enter the following blood test values:

- **Hemoglobin (Hb)**
- **Red Blood Cells (RBC)**
- **Packed Cell Volume (PCV)**
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)**
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)**

The app will predict whether anemia is detected or not based on these values.
